## About

This boilerplate serves as a quick-start template for integrating authentication into your applications. It provides a well-structured codebase with best practices for authentication, email handling, and database management, making it easier to focus on building your core application features.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Authentication**: Includes basic user authentication, API key authentication, magic link authentication, and an admin addon for managing permissions and bans.
- **Email Sending**: Integrated with the Resend SDK for handling email communication (e.g., email verification and magic links).
- **Database ORM**: Uses Prisma for database operations with a ready-to-use schema for users, sessions, accounts, and API keys.
- **TypeScript-first**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend and modify the boilerplate to suit your needs.
- **Secure**: Implements best practices for secure authentication.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with this boilerplate.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/withviktor/better-auth-integration.git
   cd better-auth-integration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

This boilerplate includes configuration options to suit various use cases. Update the following files to set up your authentication, email, and database:

- **Authentication**: Modify `src/utils/auth.ts` to configure BetterAuth (e.g., enable plugins like API keys, magic links, and OpenAPI).
- **Email Sending**: Update `src/utils/resend.ts` with your Resend API key.
- **Database**: Check `prisma/schema.prisma` to configure your database schema and connection.

## Usage

After configuring the boilerplate, you can start building your application.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the boilerplate to set up authentication:

```typescript
import { auth } from './utils/auth';

// Use the `auth` object in your application
app.use(auth.middleware);
```

## Integrations

This boilerplate includes the following key integrations:

### Authentication with BetterAuth

The `auth.ts` file pre-configures **BetterAuth** with the following features:

- **Basic User Authentication**: Email and password-based authentication with email verification.
- **API Key Authentication**: Pre-configured API key plugin for managing API access.
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Enables users to log in via email magic links.
- **Admin Addon**: Includes functionality for managing permissions and bans.
- **OpenAPI Plugin**: Generates OpenAPI documentation for authentication endpoints.

### Email Sending with Resend SDK

The `resend.ts` file integrates **Resend**, allowing you to send emails for:

- Email verification
- Magic link authentication

[View `resend.ts` source code](https://github.com/withviktor/better-auth-integration/blob/main/src/utils/resend.ts)

### Database ORM with Prisma

This boilerplate uses **Prisma** to manage database operations. It includes:

- A pre-configured `PrismaClient` for database queries.
- A detailed schema (`schema.prisma`) for managing users, sessions, accounts, and API keys.
